mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, the product of ECX and 4, and 0x10.  The potential bug lies in the unchecked values of EBX, ECX, and the resulting address.  If any of these values are unexpectedly large, it could lead to accessing memory outside the program's allocated space (an access violation), causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.  This is especially dangerous if ECX is a user-supplied value, potentially allowing for buffer overflow attacks.
